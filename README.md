### In plain language

In this study, we look at whether companies with more women on their boards also tend to do better on environmental performance.  
Instead of simply comparing companies, we first match similar firms and then see how they differ on environmental outcomes.  
We also use the biographies of directors to learn about their experience and how it may relate to environmental issues.  
Overall, we find that greater gender diversity on boards is associated with stronger environmental performance, although the strength of this relationship can vary by industry.
