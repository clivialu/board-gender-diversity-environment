### In Plain Language

In this study, we look at whether companies with more women on their boards also tend to do better on environmental performance.  
Instead of simply comparing companies, we first match similar firms and then see how they differ on environmental outcomes.  
We also use the biographies of directors to learn about their experience and how it may relate to environmental issues.  
Overall, we find that greater gender diversity on boards is associated with stronger environmental performance, although the strength of this relationship can vary by industry.

## Paper Highlight:
| # | **Why it matters** | **What the paper delivers** |
|---|--------------------|-----------------------------|
| **1** | **Settles the “mixed-evidence” debate.** Firms and scholars get conflicting signals on whether women directors help the planet. | Analyses **4,872 S&P 1500 firm-years (2009-15)** and finds a *robust* positive link between gender diversity and environmental performance, even after PSM, system-GMM and 3SLS endogeneity checks. |
| **2** | **Context flips the switch.** Diversity might not pay off equally everywhere. | Shows the effect is **significant only in “more environmentally-impacting” sectors** (energy, mining, manufacturing) and vanishes in service/retail.  |
| **3** | **Explains *how* women add value.** Counting seats isn’t enough. | Bio-content analysis reveals **female directors are ~4× more likely than males to bring environmental, HR, regulatory and public-affairs expertise** to the same board.  |
| **4** | **Best-in-class causal design.** | Combines interaction terms with PSM, dynamic panels and 3SLS to beat reverse-causality concerns and isolate diversity’s true impact.  |
| **5** | **Resource-dependence theory in action.** | Demonstrates that gender-balanced boards widen advice, legitimacy and information channels—boosting green strategy where risk is highest.  |

### Managerial Takeaways

* **Prioritise gender-balanced boards in carbon-heavy sectors.** The biggest emissions gains appear in extractive & manufacturing industries.   
* **Recruit women with green, regulatory and stakeholder skill-sets.** They provide scarce expertise that elevates board deliberations.   
* **Back diversity with strong overall governance.** High governance scores complement gender diversity, amplifying environmental pay-offs. 
* **Use diversity as strategic insurance.** Mixed-gender boards enhance legitimacy with regulators, investors and communities, lowering environmental risk exposure.
* **Tailor board reforms to industry exposure.** Service firms may see weaker returns; channel diversity initiatives where ecological stakes (and scrutiny) are greatest.
